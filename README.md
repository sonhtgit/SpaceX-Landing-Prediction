## 📌 Project Overview

The project focuses on predicting successful landings of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters — a key aspect of **SpaceX’s rocket reusability strategy**. Understanding which conditions lead to successful landings helps SpaceX optimize future missions and reduce costs.

### 🔍 Problem Statement:
**What factors most influence Falcon 9 landing outcomes?**

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Questions

- How do **launch site**, **payload mass**, **orbit type**, and **booster version** affect landing success?
- What patterns exist in **successful vs. failed** landings?
- Which **machine learning model** best predicts landing outcomes?

## 🧪 Modules Breakdown

### ✅ Module 1: Data Collection
- SpaceX REST API used to retrieve structured launch data.
- Web scraping (Wikipedia) for booster version and landing outcome details.
- Libraries: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`

### ✅ Module 2: Data Wrangling & EDA
- Merged datasets and handled missing values.
- Conducted EDA using SQL queries and visualizations.
- Identified trends and critical features like payload mass and orbit type.

### ✅ Module 3: Interactive Dashboards
- Created dynamic **Folium maps** to visualize launch sites and proximities.
- Built interactive **Plotly Dashboards** showing launch trends and success ratios.

### ✅ Module 4: Predictive Analysis
- Built classification models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN.
- Tuned models and evaluated performance.
- Best model predicted landing outcomes with strong accuracy.
